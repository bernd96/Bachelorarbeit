  By not providing "Findfub_cmake.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "fub_cmake", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "fub_cmake" with
  any of the following names:

    fub_cmakeConfig.cmake
    fub_cmake-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "fub_cmake" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "fub_cmake_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "fub_cmake" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
